## 🧠 My Summary (in my own words)

Oracle Integration Cloud is a cloud-based tool that connects different apps — whether they’re on Oracle, third-party, or on-premise. It lets me design integrations quickly using pre-built components and automates both technical and business workflows. It's powerful but made to be simple for enterprise use.
