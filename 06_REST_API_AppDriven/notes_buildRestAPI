There are two places from where you create integrations in OIC
1) Design->Integrations

  use when: there is only 1 integration team with 4-10 members
            no need of access control
2) Projects

  use when: we have multiple teams and one team should not see other teams integrations
  These teams could be patitioned by country or offering-that doesnt matter
          ex: FIN Cloud, HCM Cloud, SCM cloud
              or UK team, US team, AUS team etc 

The options under Design: Integrations, Connections, Events, Lookups, Libraries(first 5 options) are also present in Projects
But still there are some integration patterns for ex: if we want to use a connectivity agent to talk to on-prem application
Agents are only available under Design
though we can achieve access control with most of the integrations but we cant do with all of them.

some integration patterns like agents are available only under deisgn screen

first usecase: Build REST API

take first name as input
prefix hello
send response as hello firstname

when we build integration we need to follow 7-8 steps . so to understand all the steps lets start with helloworld first.
This called development workflow : has 6-7 steps ->we would see lots of new screens for the first time in OIC. focus on developement workflow.

prerequisite step to do integration is creating required connections.

1) for this usecase: do we need to talk to any external system? NO
only little string transformation and send response

2) after we build this integration(REST API) , should client be able to trigger this rest api? yes
so for this integration we need one connection->we are going to create this connection over REST adapter
Bcoz a trigger connection would determine weather a integration will be exposed as SOAP or REST.
