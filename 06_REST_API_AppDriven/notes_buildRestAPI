There are two places from where you create integrations in OIC
1) Design->Integrations

  use when: there is only 1 integration team with 4-10 members
            no need of access control
2) Projects

  use when: we have multiple teams and one team should not see other teams integrations
  These teams could be patitioned by country or offering-that doesnt matter
          ex: FIN Cloud, HCM Cloud, SCM cloud
              or UK team, US team, AUS team etc
