REST Integration -part3
we created REST API, Also configured trigger connection
we created mapper as well-receiving first name as input, prefixing hello 
and sending back response

now the next step is
we need to activate the rest api and test it


right now integration is in draft status
when integration is in draft status we will not see activate option when you click on 3 dots

when will we see option to activate integration?
by default integration will be in draft status
and after we enable tracking on the integration,
integration status changes to configured,
then we can go ahead and activate integration

so get into the API,
so after we get into Integration->how do we enable tracking?
we cick on business identifiers (I) option->
from here we will have option to enable tracking identifiers

remember ->on a rest API we can have upto 3 tracking identifiers
and you need to have atleast 1-which is a primary tracking identifier

now what is the exact usage of this identifier?

now lets go to (I) Business Identifiers
primary business identifiers
variable undefined 
(x) business identifier field
choose firstName from input sources->sources->execute->TemplateParameters->firstName
drag this source on to business identifier field: this field should be updated by drag and drop from source tree
business identifier variable
tracking_var_1(default)
this field changes to firstName

the moment you add firstName as tracking identifier
tracking_var_1=firstName
is shown in variable undefined position

now once you click save->the status of the integration changes from draft to configured

Draft         ->      Configured       ->      Active
        Enable Tracking           Activate


 now when you click on 3 dots beside the integration now it shows an option to activate
when you click on activate you see
activate integration window popup from right
for UG86 Hello Word REST API (1.0)

it has below 3 options: rb(radio button)
select tracing level
rb Production
rb Audit
rb Debug (Not recommended)
(debug has a warning that says->additionally, all payloads and all activities inside loops(upto 1000 iterations) are shown in the 
activity stream and this data is retained for a period of 24 hours. it may slowdown your system and also pose a security risk
as sensitive information from payload will be logged.)

configure runtime options
checkbox allow to run again
when you run again an integration,it creates a new instance and rund againa ny transactions

checkbox enable payload validation

now lets not explore anything else but only enable trace level as debug and activate the integration

after clicking on activate and going back to integration and clickling on 3 dots->we see run option

you will see configure and run screen

you will see method name: GET
URI path (ic/api/integration..../{firstName}

Request
URI parameters
already checkedbox firstName textbox

Response
status: instance ID:
Body Headers
1

we also have 2 buttons on right corner : endpoint metadata and track instances
--------------------
now what do we get to see?

when you click on endpoint metadata
pop up from right shows:
metadata swagger openapi
in metadata
endpoint description
endpoint URL
https://unogeeksprodoic-...../UG86/UG86_HELLO_WORLD_REST_API/1.0/sayHello/{firstName}
(client will trigger our api using this url)
swagger
https://unogeeksprodoic-...../UG86/UG86_HELLO_WORLD_REST_API/1.0/metadata/swagger
openapi
https://unogeeksprodoic-...../UG86/UG86_HELLO_WORLD_REST_API/1.0/metadata/openapi
urls are shown

resource/sayHello{firstName}
method GET
Response
Response media type: application/json
Response sample
{"Greeting":"Hello ABC"}


all the above things are shown on screen


but can we just share url with client? no we should first do unit test and then confirm its working fine then ask 3rd party to call our integration

now add value of firstname it gets displayed in the URL also

URI path (ic/api/integration..../sayHello/unogeeks1111

Request
URI parameters
already checkedbox firstName unogeeks1111

go ahead and click run

Response
status: 200 OK instance ID:22 char string (aC1hB63yEe-COaUkO-YGCQ)
Body Headers
1 {
"Greeting" : "Hello unogeeks1111"
}

Activity stream pops up when you click run:
 we see payload response and complete instance activity

now we are in test phase , can we see these intances anywhere else in OIC? yes

go to OIC console->Observability->Instances->here you see instances

you can filter number of instance syou can see based on 24 hours or 1 hour ->many instances will be present
it will be difficult for us to track our intgeration instance

how do we track it then?
on what basis?
with the help of tracking identifiers

primary identifier instance id status business identifiers duration
firstName:unogeeks aC1hB63yEe-COaUkO-YGCQ succeeded               received 6 mins ago
link to see integration code (just below primary identifier)
to look what happened in integration during runtime clcik on primary identifier
we can see activity stream and green path
wecan search for instances with primary or secondary tracking identifiers

now since integration is working share the url with client
