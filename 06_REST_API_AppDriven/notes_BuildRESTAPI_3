REST Integration -part3
we created REST API, Also configured trigger connection
we created mapper as well-receiving first name as input, prefixing hello 
and sending back response

now the next step is
we need to activate the rest api and test it


right now integration is in draft status
when integration is in draft status we will not see activate option when you click on 3 dots

when will we see option to activate integration?
by default integration will be in draft status
and after we enable tracking on the integration,
integration status changes to configured,
then we can go ahead and activate integration

so get into the API,
so after we get into Integration->how do we enable tracking?
we cick on business identifiers (I) option->
from here we will have option to enable tracking identifiers

remember ->on a rest API we can have upto 3 tracking identifiers
and you need to have atleast 1-which is a primary tracking identifier

now what is the exact usage of this identifier?

now lets go to (I) Business Identifiers
primary business identifiers
variable undefined 
(x) business identifier field
choose firstName from input sources->sources->execute->TemplateParameters->firstName
drag this source on to business identifier field: this field should be updated by drag and drop from source tree
business identifier variable
tracking_var_1(default)
this field changes to firstName

the moment you add firstName as tracking identifier
tracking_var_1=firstName
is shown in variable undefined position

now once you click save->the status of the integration changes from draft to configured

Draft         ->      Configured       ->      Active
        Enable Tracking           Activate


 now when you click on 3 dots beside the integration now it shows an option to activate
when you click on activate you see
activate integration window popup from right
for UG86 Hello Word REST API (1.0)

it has below options:
select tracing level
Production
Audit
Debug (Not recommended)
(debug has a warning that says->additionally, all payloads and all activities inside loops(upto 1000 iterations) are shown in the 
activity stream and this data is retained for a period of 24 hours. it may slowdown your system and also pose a security risk
as sensitive information from payload will be logged.)

configure runtime options
checkbox allow to run again
when you run again an integration,it creates a new instance and rund againa ny transactions

checkbox enable payload validation
