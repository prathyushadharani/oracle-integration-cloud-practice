REST API-Video 7-Part2 
We created REST API (PRADH Hello World REST API) and we need to configure the trigger node first.
we can see the trigger connection popping up
we need to configure the trigger connection first.

Configure Basic Info:
(REST Trigger)

when we configure the trigger connection it prompts us to give a name to the endpoint.
(What do you want to call your endpoint?
For examplae: GetListOfOpportunitiesForCustomer)

this can be anything like abc
But lets see what our RESTAPI does.
It takes firstName(String) as input, prefix Hello and send it back as response

since it says hello lets name endpoint as 'sayHello'

sayHello

Whenever you build a REST API in OIC remember -from one single REST API that you can build 
you can expose multiple branches or 
you can configure multiple endpoints if required

since this is our first rest api we will not configure multiple branches or multiple endpoints

we will do only 1 operation
But we will notice in integrations like PO REST API (Purchase order rest api-5th integration)
we will see how to expose multiple rest endpoints/multiple operations/multiple branches
from 1 single rest api

just in case we need to have multiple branches in REST API we need to tick 
the box that says 'Select to configure multiple resources or verbs.(maximum 11)
