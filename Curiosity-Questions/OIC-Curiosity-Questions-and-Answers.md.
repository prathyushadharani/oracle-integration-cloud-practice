# 🧠 1. If two systems send data at the same time, how does OIC decide which runs first?
Simple Explanation

OIC executes requests in parallel. Every incoming event creates a separate integration instance.

Real-Time Example

If Shopify, Amazon & Magento send orders at 10:00:02, OIC runs 3 instances parallelly.

Interview Answer

“OIC is event-driven and supports parallel execution. Each trigger creates its own instance.”

# 🧠 2. Can an integration run WITHOUT any trigger?
Simple Explanation

Yes, using a Scheduled Integration.

Real-Time Example

Fetch DB records daily at 2 AM → sync to ERP.

Interview Answer

“Scheduled integrations run automatically without external triggers.”

# 🧠 3. What happens if a REST trigger receives invalid JSON?
Simple Explanation

OIC returns 400 Bad Request and does NOT start the integration.

Real-Time Example

If mobile app sends { "id": }, OIC rejects it.

Interview Answer

“OIC validates inbound payload. Invalid JSON fails before the flow starts.”

# 🧠 4. Can one integration call another integration?
Simple Explanation

Yes—using REST/SOAP invoke.

Real-Time Example

Order Integration → Customer Integration → Email Integration.

Interview Answer

“This is Integration Chaining for reusability.”

# 🧠 5. Can an integration work even when the target system is down?
Simple Explanation

Yes—use Stage File, Queues, or DB staging.

Real-Time Example

ERP is down → invoice file stored → retry later.

Interview Answer

“We design resilient flows using staging + retry patterns.”

# 🧠 6. How do you transform completely different source & target structures?
Simple Explanation

Using Mapper with:

Drag-and-drop

Functions

Loops

Real-Time Example

JSON order → XML invoice.

Interview Answer

“OIC mapper supports looping, conditions, and rich functions.”

# 🧠 7. How to debug a complex map without running the whole integration?
Simple Explanation

Use Mapper Test / Validate.

Real-Time Example

Load sample JSON → see mapped XML.

Interview Answer

“We can test transformations independently inside the mapper.”

# 🧠 8. What does Smart Mapping do?
Simple Explanation

Auto-maps fields with matching names.

Real-Time Example

CustomerName → CustomerName.

Interview Answer

“Smart mapping accelerates development but must be reviewed.”

# 🧠 9. When should you use Lookups?
Simple Explanation

When converting value → value
(e.g., codes to names).

Real-Time Example

A: "CA" → B: "California".

Interview Answer

“Lookups externalize cross-reference logic.”

# 🧠 10. How do lookups behave with 10,000+ rows?
Simple Explanation

Performance remains stable; OIC loads lookup into memory.

Real-Time Example

Country code tables.

Interview Answer

“OIC preloads lookups so large ones still perform well.”

# 🧠 11. Can OIC process a 1GB file?
Simple Explanation

No.
Max limit ~50 MB depending on adapter.

Real-Time Example

200MB file → rejected.

Interview Answer

“OIC is not an ETL tool; file limits apply.”

# 🧠 12. Why does OIC split big files automatically?
Simple Explanation

To avoid memory overload (chunking).

Real-Time Example

Supplier file broken into 200-record batches.

Interview Answer

“OIC uses chunking for reliability.”

# 🧠 13. Can a scheduled integration skip execution if no new data?
Simple Explanation

Yes—use a decision step.

Real-Time Example

0 new rows → exit.

Interview Answer

“Scheduled flows can self-terminate based on conditions.”

# 🧠 14. What happens if scheduler runs while a deployment happens?
Simple Explanation

Running instance finishes → next run uses new version.

Interview Answer

“OIC uses safe versioning during deployment.”

# 🧠 15. How do you build automatic error-handling & retry?
Simple Explanation

Use Fault Handler + Retry Integration.

Real-Time Example

Failed invoices → sent to retry queue → retried later.

Interview Answer

“I design global fault handlers + retry patterns for resilience.”

# 🧠 16. Where does OIC store faults? Can we reprocess one record?
Simple Explanation

Stored in Monitoring → Errors.
Yes—you can reprocess individual messages.

Interview Answer

“OIC supports granular reprocessing.”

# 🧠 17. How does OIC talk to an on-premise DB securely?
Simple Explanation

Using Connectivity Agent installed inside customer network.

Real-Time Example

Hospital DB → Agent → OIC.

Interview Answer

“It creates a secure outbound tunnel—no exposure of DB.”

# 🧠 18. What happens if the connectivity agent goes down?
Simple Explanation

Integrations fail or retry based on config.

Real-Time Example

Agent down 5 mins → requests fail → resume on recovery.

Interview Answer

“OIC returns connection failure if agent is unavailable.”

# 🧠 19. How does OIC upload a file to ERP UCM & trigger ESS job?
Simple Explanation

Steps:

Upload file to UCM

Run ESS job

Real-Time Example

Upload supplier file → run “Import Suppliers”.

Interview Answer

“This is the standard FBDI pattern.”

# 🧠 20. Why two steps (UCM + ESS)?
Simple Explanation

ERP Cloud needs:

File in UCM

Job to process file

Interview Answer

“FBDI requires upload + job execution.”

# 🧠 21. Can a VBCS app trigger an integration?
Simple Explanation

Yes—via REST call from a button.

Real-Time Example

“Create Invoice” button → OIC → ERP.

Interview Answer

“VBCS integrates seamlessly with OIC using REST.”

# 🧠 22. Can VBCS update ERP directly?
Simple Explanation

Through OIC (not directly).

Real-Time Example

Form → OIC REST → ERP.

Interview Answer

“VBCS calls OIC integrations which handle ERP communication.”

# 🧠 23. How do human tasks pause a PCS process?
Simple Explanation

Process waits until user completes the task.

Real-Time Example

Manager approval.

Interview Answer

“PCS uses BPMN human task constructs.”

# 🧠 24. Can PCS trigger different integrations based on conditions?
Simple Explanation

Yes—using gateways.

Real-Time Example

Order > 10k → Approval integration
Else → Auto process

Interview Answer

“PCS supports conditional integration invocation.”

# 🧠 25. Smart handling of partial successes in ERP invoice loads?
Simple Explanation

Split:

Successful

Failed
Retry only failed.

Real-Time Example

100 invoices: 95 success → reprocess 5.

Interview Answer

“Design batches to support partial reprocessing.”

# 🧠 26. End-to-end flow: REST → OIC → DB → UCM → ESS → ERP
Simple Explanation

Full FBDI pipeline:

REST trigger

Stage file

DB insert / CSV

Upload to UCM

Trigger ESS

Poll job status

Send final response

Interview Answer

“This is the enterprise-grade OIC blueprint pattern.”
