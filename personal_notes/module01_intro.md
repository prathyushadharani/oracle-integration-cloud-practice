# Module 01 ‚Äì Introduction to Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC)

## üéØ Topics Covered
- What is OIC and why it's used
- Difference between OIC and on-prem SOA
- OIC as iPaaS ‚Äì Cloud-first middleware
- Key components: Integrations, VBCS, PCS
- Connectors vs Adapters
- Real-world use cases

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Notes

- OIC = Cloud platform for integrating apps, services, and data
- Unified solution with **Integration**, **App Development (VBCS)**, and **Process Automation (PCS)**
- Supports REST, SOAP, FBDI, CSV, FTP, etc.
- Adapters = prebuilt connectors (e.g., ERP, HCM, SFDC)
- Used in place of SOA Suite in cloud-native architectures
- Simple UI, drag-drop model, built-in fault handling

## üîç Things to Revisit Later
- What's the difference between VBCS & PCS?
- Where does B2B or MFT fit in?
- How OIC fits in larger enterprise architecture?

## üß† Summary in My Own Words
OIC is Oracle's modern cloud-based integration platform. It allows connecting cloud and on-prem apps using pre-built adapters with very little code. It's simpler than traditional SOA and includes tools for automation (PCS) and app building (VBCS).
