Why do we need product like OIC in todays world?

If we look at the IT landscape of companies say 5-10 years back, 
and say am running a manufacturing firm and we need to install E-Business suite 
what should we do?

we need to go to Oracle , buy required application and database servers
They need to ship them and we need to receive them at our location 
and we need to onboard an Oracle application DBA Team -
a team of 5-10 members
The team would install the application on those servers

after application installation is done remember
my team would be responsible for keeping the application running 24*7,
disaster recovery, maintanance , applying any upgrdes, upgrade application once in a while

disadvantages:
1) huge upfront investment to buy the servers
2) maintain a team to look after the application
3) also spend some time looking after the application to keep it up and 
running

but gone are those days:
now if you go to oracle and say I want to use oracle finance modules in 
cloud
what we need to do

you dont need to buy the servers
you dont need to have the team
you dont have to install it

Oracle will look at our base location-say for example we are based 
out of hyderabad
Oracle has a data center in hyderabad itself

what would oracle do?
oracle would go to hyderabad datacenter and in one of the machines/servers 
of hyd data center it would install oracle fusion cloud application

oracle would also share a link to access oracle fusion cloud instance url
so after the oracle fusion application is installed in cloud in the datacenter
closest to your location, they would be sharing the application url with you and

-we would access the oracle applications installed in cloud
-cloud means the application is installed in one of the oracle datacenters

now when we access the oracle application url, we wouldbe redirected to a sign in page
