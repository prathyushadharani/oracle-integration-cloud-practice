# 🚀 Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) Hands-On Practice

Welcome! This repository documents my **end-to-end hands-on learning journey** with Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), following the UnoGeeks OIC course. It includes:

- ✅ Integration summaries (App-Driven, Scheduled, Real-Time, SaaS-to-SaaS)
- 📎 Reusable artifacts and screenshots
- 🧪 Test scenarios & edge cases
- 📚 Personal reference notes, API docs, and more

This serves as my **project showcase** and a revision-ready portfolio.

## 💡 Why I Built This

- 🔨 To **build confidence** through consistent practice  
- 🧪 To document what I’ve **actually done**, not just watched  
- 🎯 To create a ready-made **portfolio** for interviews and job search  
- 🗃️ To use it as a **revision tool** for future projects or client work
