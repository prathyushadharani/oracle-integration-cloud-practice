build soap service in oic
usecase: build a soap service in oic which takes string name as input, prefix hello and send it back as response

1)create trigger conn with soap adapter

trigger conn determines:
whether your integration is exposed as soap or rest
what request payload needs to be passed to invoke integration

build the integration

activate the integration

test the soap service wsdl using soap ui

we are doing this simple usecase to understand how a soap service works in oic


WSDL:

1) abstract wsdl 
2) concrete wsdl 

step 1: create required conn
do we need to talk to external systems? NO

UG86 Hello World SOAP Conn-Role: Trigger

in REST trigger conn we only provided security details(oAuth 2.0) while configuring rest trigger connection-
which means we did not provide any connection details while configuring the REST conn

and while using the rest conn as trigger conn we have given the connection properties like endpoint uri etc,
request payload, response payload

which means if you change the name of ug86 hello world rest conn to ug86 rest conn
then you can use this rest conn for another PO integration with different input and output
bcoz input and output that is request and response are configured in integration in the trigger conn
not in the conn itself
