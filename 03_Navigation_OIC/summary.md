# Module 3: Navigation in Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC)

## 🔑 Key Topics Covered
- OIC **Home Page Overview**
  - Quick Start Cards
  - Navigation shortcuts for Integrations, Monitoring, Settings
- **Integrations Designer Page**
  - Overview of 7 core options:
    - App-Driven Orchestration
    - Scheduled Orchestration
    - File Transfer
    - REST
    - SOAP
    - Connectivity Agents
    - B2B Integrations (if visible)
- **Monitoring Options**:

## 🧠 My Notes
- The **“Integrations”** tab is the main workspace where all flows are created and managed.
- Monitoring shows instance history, success/failure counts.
- Settings are often skipped but crucial — especially when deploying in real-time projects (e.g., setting up a certificate for HTTPS endpoint).
- Integration styles are selectable only once during integration creation.

## 🧪 What I Explored
- [ ] Navigated through the Integration Designer
- [ ] Checked Monitoring → Tracking for runtime logs
- [ ] Reviewed Settings tab for Adapters, Certificates, Lookups

## 📌 Summary
This module helped me become familiar with the OIC interface, especially where to design, monitor, and manage integrations. It builds confidence to start building real flows using different integration styles.
