# Module 2: Oracle Cloud Account Sign Up & OCI Console Overview

## ðŸ”‘ Key Topics Covered
- How to sign up for a **Free Oracle Cloud Account** (OCI Free Tier)
- Overview of the **OCI Console** (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
  - Navigation: Home, Hamburger menu, services
  - Key components: Compute, Networking, Storage, Identity
- Provisioning a new **Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) instance**
- Understanding **IDCS** (Identity Cloud Service) for user authentication
- Creating users and assigning roles in OIC (e.g., ServiceDeveloper, ServiceMonitor)

## ðŸ§  My Notes
- Oracle gives $300 free credits valid for 30 days
- OIC sits under the "Platform Services" category
- Role assignment is essential: without it, you wonâ€™t access OIC designer page
- IDCS handles user security and group-based access control for OIC

## ðŸ§ª What I Did
- [ ] Signed up for Free Tier account on cloud.oracle.com
- [ ] Explored OCI Dashboard & menu structure
- [ ] Tried provisioning a new OIC instance
- [ ] Added myself as a user and assigned OIC roles (via IDCS)

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
This module provided hands-on guidance to set up an Oracle Cloud environment and gave me the foundation to deploy, access, and manage my own OIC instances. I now understand the relationship between OCI, OIC, and IDCS.
